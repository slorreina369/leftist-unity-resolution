        <h2>A Better World is Possible</h2>
        <p>
            We are currently existing in a time where infighting is not an
            option. While the Republican party is gaining power, the Democratic
            party is fighting amongst itself for one single solution that will
            win votes in all areas of the US. This is not realistic. We need to
            trust the constituents to vote for the best cadidate in their local
            communities. We must work together to get money out of democratic
            primaries and prevent national politics from influencing the needs
            of local communitites.

            This resolution has been created in order to embrace local support
            towards this goal, with the understanding that we know who
            represents our communities better than those on a national scale
            because we live here. Our hope, is that this resolution can be used
            in counties across the United States. This, with the end goal of
            placing it in the hands of the Democratic National Committee as a
            demonstration that we are against outside influence. A practice,
            which has a history of disenfranchising grassroots movements, that
            only serve to weaken support across the party.
